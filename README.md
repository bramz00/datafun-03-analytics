# datafun-03-analytics

# Project for module 3 of Data Analytics


# I added a .gitignore file, a requirements.txt file, and a README.md file. I also added
# a powershell script for automatically running the git commands to update the repo, called gitquick.ps1


# datafun-03-analytics

This project demonstrates how to fetch and process various types of 
data (Excel, JSON, text, and CSV) using Python. 

The repository includes:

- Four example fetchers: Scripts to retrieve data from the web.
- Four example processors: Scripts to analyze and process the fetched data.

Start by running the examples to understand their functionality, and then build your own scripts to fetch and process data of your choice (using each of these example types).

## Project Requirements

- VS Code
- Git
- Python 

## Professional Python Workflow

See [pro-analytics-01](https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-01/)

## Commands to Manage Virtual Environment

For Windows PowerShell (change if using Mac/Linux)

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
py -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
## Commands to Run Python Scripts

Remember to activate your .venv (and install packages if they haven't been installed yet) before running files.
Verify that all required packages are included in requirements.txt (and have NOT been commented out).


```shell
py example_get_csv.py
py example_get_excel.py
py example_get_json.py
py example_get_text.py

py example_process_csv.py
py example_process_excel.py
py example_process_json.py
py example_process_text.py

py yourname_get_csv.py
py yourname_get_excel.py
py yourname_get_json.py
py yourname_get_text.py

py yourname_process_csv.py
py yourname_process_excel.py
py yourname_process_json.py
py yourname_process_text.py

```

## Commands to Git add-commit-push

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "custom message"
git push -u origin main
```

## Create and Run Your Data Fetchers
1. Find data files on the web for each type (CSV, Excel, JSON, and text).  
2. Create your own Python script to fetch each type of data and save it in a folder named **data**.
3. Name your scripts:
   1. yourname_get_csv.py
   2. yourname_get_excel.py
   3. yourname_get_json.py
   4. yourname_get_text.py
4. Implement your data-processing logic in small steps:
   - Fetch data for one file type.
   - Test, verify, and Git add-commit-push.
  
## Create and Run Your Data Processors
1. Determine a simple metric from each of your data files.  
2. Create your own Python script to read the data, process it, and save it in a folder named **data_processed**.
3. Name your scripts:
   1. yourname_process_csv.py
   2. yourname_process_excel.py
   3. yourname_process_json.py
   4. yourname_process_text.py
4. Work incrementally, using git add-commit-push after each bit of progress. 

## Update README.md to Describe Your Work
1. In your README.md, list each of your fetchers with a short description.
2. In your README.md, list each of your processors with a short description of what it does. 
3. Include the execution commands to run your fetchers and processors. 

## Helpful Documentation
If you're unsure about any of the setup steps or tools, consult these resources:
- [requests library documentation](https://docs.python-requests.org)

### Tips
- Use descriptive filenames for the data you fetch - and proper file extensions.
- Work incrementally—verify each small step works before moving to the next.
- The examples are required reading - use them to learn and understand first. 
- Test each script carefully before proceeding.
- Use meaningful commit messages when pushing to GitHub to document your progress.

## Review Commit History
Once your project is complete, review your commit history in GitHub under the **Commits** tab. 
Ensure your commit messages are clear and professional.
